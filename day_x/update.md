i already did numpy before but got stuck after coming to university 

disturbing roomates and unserious classmates so everything got paused

but in the mean time i sort of completed my python basics(still unsure about depth of my knowledge but sure about breadth anout the language)
i also did numpy (sort of too) but now i am back in full throttle

now i will re revise all of python and numpy and move quickly learning all diff languages ml deep learnong bioengineering like there is no tomorrow

so i will be starting revising numpy starting today 

only wish is to be consistent and only stop commiting my learning during exams only
