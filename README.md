# 🧠 dev-in-queue

Welcome to **dev-in-queue** — a raw, honest log of my journey from beginner to developer.

## 📌 What This Is

A daily (or almost-daily) journal of:
- 🧩 What I learned  
- 🛠️ What I built  
- 🧠 What I struggled with  
- 🚀 What’s next  

Whether it's Python, C++, Git, DSA, AiMl or side projects — everything goes in here.

## 📅 How It’s Structured

📁 dev-in-queue/  
├── Day01.md  
├── Day02.md  
├── ...  
└── README.md  

Each file contains:
- Topics covered  
- Code snippets  
- Reflections  
- Resources used  

## 🚧 Why I’m Doing This

I’m documenting this for:
- 📖 Accountability  
- 🧠 Reinforcement of concepts  
- 🧑‍💻 Future me (and maybe you) to look back and learn from
