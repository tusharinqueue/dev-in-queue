# 🧠 dev-in-queue

Welcome to **dev-in-queue** — a raw, honest log of my journey from beginner to developer.

## 📌 What This Is

A daily (or almost-daily) journal of:
- 🧩 What I learned  
- 🛠️ What I built  
- 🧠 What I struggled with  
- 🚀 What’s next  

Whether it's Python, C++, Git, DSA, AiMl or side projects — everything goes in here.

## 📅 How It’s Structured
```text
📁 dev-in-queue/
├── day_x/
│   ├── notes.md
│   ├── script.py / main.cpp / index.html
│   ├── project.ipynb / sketch.js
│   └── ...
├── day_y/
│   ├── notes.md
│   ├── another_script.py / tool.c / test.html
│   └── helper_data.json / result.txt
└── README.md
```


Each day folder contains:

- 🧠 `notes.md`  
  - Topics covered  
  - Reflections  
  - Resources used  

- 💻 Code files  
  - Anything from timepass to serious — dev doodles included

## 🚧 Why I’m Doing This

I’m documenting this for:
- 📖 Accountability  
- 🧠 Reinforcement of concepts  
- 🧑‍💻 Future me (and maybe you) to look back and learn from
